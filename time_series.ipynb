    "##### This project aims to tackle Corporation Favorita's crucial need to optimize product stocking by developing machine learning models to forecast demand across their Ecuadorian stores. By accurately predicting product sales, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline inventory management by building time series regression models that will forecast unit sales for thousands of items, helping avoid both overstock and stockouts. This data-driven approach will improve operational efficiency and support strategic decisions at Corporation Favorita. Ultimately, the project will ensure that Favorita stores consistently have the right products available for their customers."
